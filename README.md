SequenceGame
============

This is a basic game I'm working on to learn Android app development.  Ultimately, it will display a sequence of colors to match, and then display various color sequences, occasionally repeating the initial sequence.  The sequences will continue to change until the player taps the screen when they think they see the matching sequence.
